/ This code arranges to include the application stylesheet and JavaScript, which are part of the asset pipeline (Section 5.2.1), together with the Rails method csp_meta_tag, which implements Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and csrf_meta_tags, which mitigates cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. (One huge advantage of using a mature framework like Rails is that it worries about such things so that we donâ€™t have to.)
